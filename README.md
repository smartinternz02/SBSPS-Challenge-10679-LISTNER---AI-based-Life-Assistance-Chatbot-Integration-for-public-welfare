LISTNER - AI-based Life Assistance Chatbot Integration for public welfare
This code is an example of a chatbot which uses technologies such as NLP and data analysis.
This generates the responses using the chatbot created on telegram and openAI which is being used by using the API.
This code is made as a project for IBM-hack challenge 2023
I hope that this chatbot helps in social welfare.
